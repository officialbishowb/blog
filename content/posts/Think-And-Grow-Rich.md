## 📖 Book Review – April 2024

> **Title:** Think and Grow Rich  
> **Author:** Napoleon Hill
> **Finished on:** April 2024


### What is this blog about?
From now on I will be doing a monthly book summary of the book I read in a specific month. It will be a short summary of what the book is about, some key takeaways, and my personal opinion/recommendation of the book.
This book, Think and Grow Rich, is the first non-fiction book I read. I mean, I did read some books before, but it was mostly because I **had** to (school and stuff). My goal for this year is to read one book every month, but as you can see it did take me some time to actually get started - but hey, *better now than never*, right?

The motivation for this type of blog is to:
1. share my perspective of the book
2. have a place to write about it so I can look back for a quick summary if I ever need it.

> Let us get started.
### Why I Read It  
I really don't know. I wanted to start reading more, so I went online and searched for recommended books, and that's where I found it.
### Summary  
So what are the main things to take away from this book?
##### Having a burning desire
Starting with the first chapter, **Desire**, which is essentially to have a *burning desire* to become rich - wishing will not get you there. Here Hill lays out six *definite* practical steps for transforming your desire for riches into its financial equivalent:
1. Have the **exact** **amount** of money you desire - e.g., *X.XX* €
2. Decide what you intend to **give in** return for the money
3. **Define** a **date** when you intend to possess the money
4. Write a clear, concise **statement**
5. Create a **definite** **plan** on how you intend to achieve this desire
6. **Read** your written statement aloud daily

These six steps are helpful not only for accumulating money but for any definite goal.

> There is a difference between "wishing for a thing" and "being ready to receive it".
##### Most powerful positive emotions: faith, love, and sex

In chapter two everything is about **faith**, a state which may be *induced* through repetition, such as repeated instruction to the subconscious mind. He notes how religionists have told people to "have faith" but failed to explain *how* to have faith. Faith is, as the book calls it, the "external elixir" that gives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought; it is the starting point of accumulation of riches and the basis of many miracles.

> If a man repeats a lie over and over, he will eventually accept the lie as truth.

Hill then explains that many people's greatest weakness is lack of self-confidence, and that this can be surmounted and translated into courage through the **self-confidence formula**:

1. I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my definite purpose
2. I realize that the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in (physical) action
3. Any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means
4. I have written down a description of my definite chief aim in my life
5. No wealth or position can endure unless built upon truth and justice

I have to say the book contains many stories, such as from the U.S. Steel corporation, which I find useful because they explain the topics more deeply. For this summary I will go through each chapter and try to summarize it as briefly as possible. Throughout the first and second chapters the term **autosuggestion** is often mentioned, and chapter three focuses on it.

> The autosuggestion is a term which applies to all suggestion and all self-administered stimuli which reach one's mind through the five senses.

So basically it means talking to yourself in a way that influences your thoughts, feelings, or actions. No thought, negative or positive, can enter your subconscious mind without the help of autosuggestion; thus you have significant control over what reaches your subconscious mind. As stated in the first chapter, once you read the written statement aloud daily, you communicate with your subconscious mind with faith that one day you will achieve your desire.

##### Specialized knowledge vs general knowledge

Generally, there are two kinds of knowledge - specialized and general. While having general knowledge is nice, it is of little use for accumulating money by itself. Knowledge will not automatically attract money unless you organize it and direct it through practical plans of action to reach the definite end you set at the beginning. In the book, Hill explains that an educated person is not necessarily someone who has a lot of general or specialized knowledge; rather, it is someone who can acquire what they want or its equivalent without violating the rights of others. Any person is educated if they know where to get the knowledge when they need it - he calls this the **Master Mind**.

To transfer your desire into its monetary equivalent you may require specialized knowledge of the service you intend to offer in return for money. However, you don't need all specialized knowledge yourself to accumulate great fortunes - instead you should have a group of **Master Mind**: people who possess knowledge useful in the accumulation of money. That said, don't stop pursuing knowledge; people who think studying ends after school are probably doomed to mediocrity. Also, knowing where you can "purchase" knowledge is useful.

1. Own experience and education
2. Experience and education available through cooperation
3. Colleges / Universities
4. Public libraries
5. Special training courses

##### The workshop of the mind

> Your impulse, the desire, is given shape, form and action through the aid of the **imaginative** faculty of mind

This chapter focuses on how imagination is a crucial step toward riches. Generally, there are two forms of imagination:

1. Synthetic imagination
   With this you may arrange old concepts, ideas, and plans into new combinations. This imagination creates *nothing* on its own, as it only works with what you feed it.
2. Creative imagination
   This has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence. Through this, "hunches" and "inspirations" are received and new ideas are created.

Your imagination may have become weak due to inaction but can be revived through *use*.

> Desire is only a thought, an impulse.

It has no value until it has been transformed into its physical counterpart. In transforming the impulse of desire into money, synthetic imagination is mostly used. However, circumstances may arise where your creative imagination needs to be put into action as well.

I have skipped some details, but it is mostly about how to put your imagination into practical use, which I don't find interesting to include in full here (though one should read it once).

> Success requires no explanations
> Failure permits no alibis

##### Building the definite plan

As you know, the first chapter focused on the six steps - having a definite amount of money and so on. This chapter goes deeper into creating a **definite plan** and how to build plans that will be practical.

1. Ally yourself with a group of people you might need for carrying out your plan - **Master Mind**, remember?
2. Decide what you may offer the individual members of your group (before forming your **Master Mind**)
3. Arrange meetings with your **Master Mind**, ideally twice a week
4. Perfect harmony is the **key**. If you fail to maintain it, expect failure

Why have a **Master Mind**? Nobody in this world has sufficient experience or education to ensure the accumulation of great fortune. You need long-term cooperation with other people.

> No man is ever whipped until he quits - in his own mind

> A quitter never wins - and a winner never quits

Now you have your **Master Mind**; you need leadership to maintain it. Here are some important factors:

1. Unwavering courage
   No one wants a leader who lacks self-confidence and courage
2. Self-control
   If you can't control yourself, how do you expect to control others?
3. Keen sense of justice
   You need a sense of fairness and justice to retain respect
4. Definiteness of decision
   Be sure of your decision
5. Definiteness of plans
   You must plan your work - no guesswork
6. Doing more than paid for
7. Having a pleasing personality
   A careless person can't become a successful leader
8. Having sympathy and understanding
9. Master of detail
10. Willingness to assume full responsibility for mistakes
11. Cooperation
   You must understand and apply the principle of cooperation

There are two types of leadership: one by *force* and the other by *consent*. History is filled with leaderships by force which can't endure.

This chapter is long but useful; it describes why leadership fails, where leadership is required (such as in politics), and how you can market your services - through advertising, in person, and so on (some methods are outdated but understandable given the book's age).

##### Major causes of failure: Decision

Lack of decision is in the list of the 30 major causes of failure. Procrastination, the opposite of decision, is something everyone has to conquer.

Successful people decide promptly, and if they change the decision they approach the change slowly. People who take decisions very slowly but change them quickly often fail to accumulate wealth. Many are easily influenced by the **opinions** of others and thus fail to transform their desire into its physical equivalent - if you are influenced by others' opinions, you have no desire of your own.

> Tell the world what you intend to do, but first show it

##### Will power and desire = irresistible pair

People who accumulate great fortunes are often labeled *cold-blooded* and ruthless and are therefore misunderstood. What they actually have is **will-power** mixed with **persistence** and a firm backing of their desires. **Persistence**, like **Decision**, is also one of the major causes of success; lack of persistence is a weakness common to the majority of people but can be overcome by effort. There is no substitute for persistence.

Some symptoms that might occur due to lack of persistence:

- Failure to recognize and clearly define exactly what one wants
- Lack of interest in acquiring specialized knowledge
- Habit of blaming others for one's mistakes
- *Wishing* instead of *willing*
- Fear of criticism
- ...

I listed only about one-third of the symptoms mentioned in the book to keep this summary concise.

If you have recognized a lack of persistence, here are four simple steps to develop it:
1. A definite purpose backed by burning desire for its fulfillment
2. A definite plan, expressed in continuous action
3. A mind closed tightly against negative and discouraging influences - including negative suggestion from relatives, friends, and acquaintances
4. A friendly alliance with one or more people who will encourage you to follow through with both plan and purpose

##### How to attain and apply power

Power is essential in the accumulation of money, as plans are useless without sufficient power to translate them into action. But how do you attain and apply power?

First, the word **power** may be defined as *organized and intelligently directed knowledge*. In the book it is used to mean organized effort sufficient to enable an individual to transmute desire into its monetary equivalent.

The sources of knowledge, as **power**, include:
1. Infinite Intelligence - this refers to the *Creative Imagination*
2. Accumulated experience - knowledge and experience available in libraries, online, or taught in schools and colleges
3. Experiment and research - new facts are gathered, classified, and organized daily; turn to this source when knowledge is not available through accumulated experience

You can use any other external source to acquire knowledge and convert it to power by organizing it into definite plans and turning it into action.

Master Mind is defined as *coordination of knowledge and effort, in a spirit of harmony between two or more people, for the attainment of a definite purpose*. Without the **Master Mind**, no individual can have great power.

##### Mind that works day and night

Your subconscious mind consists of a field of consciousness in which information reaches through the five senses and can be recalled or withdrawn. The mind may be a link between the finite mind and Infinite Intelligence. Once you accept the existence of your subconscious mind and understand the possibilities, you will comprehend the significance of the instructions given in the first chapter. 

Everything that is created by a person begins as a thought impulse; a person does not create anything without first having it in thought.

The major *positive* emotions are:
1. desire
2. faith
3. love
4. sex
5. enthusiasm
6. romance
7. hope

The *negative* emotions include:
8. fear
9. jealousy
10. revenge
11. greed
12. superstition
13. anger

##### Broadcasting and receiving station

The human brain is both a broadcasting and receiving station for the vibration of thought. Every human brain is capable of picking up *vibrations of thought* released by other brains or its own (through the subconscious mind) and receiving them via the *Creative Imagination*. The emotion of sex (chapter ten) stands at the top of the list in intensity and driving force. When a brain is stimulated by the emotion of sex, it vibrates at a rapid rate; when the emotion is absent, the *Creative Imagination* may become highly receptive to ideas. 

##### The sixth sense

The portion of the subconscious mind referred to as the *Creative Imagination* is also known as the **sixth sense**. This imagination, as already stated, is the receiving set through which ideas, plans, and thoughts are flashed (hunches, inspirations) into the mind. However, someone who has not mastered the other principles of this philosophy cannot be described as having the sixth sense, since the person has no experience with which the sixth sense may be compared.

So this covers most of the book. The last chapter sums up many things and has subtopics like *The Six Basic Fears*, then digs deeper into these fears, some self-analysis test questions, and so on - which I don't find necessary to include here (but they are helpful if you have read the other chapters). 

### Personal reflection
As my first non-fiction book, I found it quite good. However, at the beginning I found it a little hard to read and understand some sentences (which I still do). The book explains many things well, like desire, why people fail, how the brain works with emotions, and finally the importance of a **Master Mind**. From my perspective, the main part is the first chapter with the six steps; the rest of the chapters expand on those steps.

### Would I recommend it?
Yes - you should definitely read this book once. Even though it might not have practical things you can apply immediately, it explains concepts required for the accumulation of money.

### Looking ahead
It will be the famous book by Robert T. Kiyosaki. **Rich Dad Poor Dad**.
