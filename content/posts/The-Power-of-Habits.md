## 📖 Book Review – November 2024

> **Title:** The Power of Habits
> **Author:**  Charles Duhigg

### Why I Read It  
Well, habits are something we can always improve, and since my last reading about it (Atomic Habits), I wanted to read another book on the topic.

#### The Habit Loop

> [!abstract] How Habits Work

The **basal ganglia** stores habits.

The process that transforms an action into an automatic routine is called **"chunking."**  
- It forms the foundation of how habits emerge.

Habits exist because the brain is constantly looking for ways to **save effort**.

The **habit loop** illustrates how a habit functions:

- **Cue (Trigger)**  
  The cue tells your brain to go into automatic mode and activate a habit.

- **Routine**  
  The cue triggers the routine - which can be physical, mental, or emotional.

- **Reward**  
  After performing the routine, a **reward** follows.

This process becomes more and more automatic over time.

Habits can form even **without our conscious permission**.  
For example: eating fast food once a month can easily turn into a weekly pattern.

Learning to **identify the cue and the reward** allows us to **change the routine**, and thus **transform a habit**.

#### The Cravings of the Brain

> [!abstract] How to Create New Habits

**Create a craving** - this is what drives the habit loop  
(see [#1 - The Habit Loop](#the-habit-loop))

1. Identify a **simple and distinctive cue**  
2. Clearly define the **reward**

**Habits** create a neurologically embedded **craving**.

To form new habits:  
**Cue + Routine + Reward + Reinforced Craving**

Simply having a cue and a reward is not enough.  
Only when the brain **starts expecting the reward** - and releases **endorphins** in anticipation - does the behavior become automatic.

> Craving is the essential force behind new habits.

#### The Golden Rule of Habit Change

> [!abstract] Why Change Is Possible

To change a habit: **keep the cue and reward, but change the routine.**

> Real habit change requires effort and understanding of the underlying craving.

Many habits can be changed by keeping the **cue** and **reward** the same but altering the **routine**.  
However, truly overcoming deep or destructive habits often requires something more: **belief**.

- Belief that change is possible  
- Belief that one can get better  
- Belief that life can improve

> Belief is often the key ingredient in lasting transformation.

#### Keystone Habits or the Ballad of Paul O'Neill

> [!abstract] The Habits That Matter Most

**Keystone habits** create **small wins** - seemingly minor improvements that trigger powerful ripple effects.

When you build new structures around these habits, they can influence and transform other behaviors.

> *Small wins lead to big change.*

For example:  
Developing the habit of **eating healthy** can improve:

- Physical health  
- Energy levels  
- Confidence  
- Focus  

Changing **one habit** can cascade into other positive behaviors.

#### Starbucks and the Culture of Success

> [!abstract] When Willpower Becomes Automatic

> **Willpower** is one of the most important keystone habits for personal success.

It's a **learnable skill**, not a fixed trait.  
While competence remains stable over time, **willpower fluctuates**.

- Some days you feel motivated to go running - other days, not at all.

At Starbucks, employees are taught strategies to strengthen self-discipline:  
**LATTE** - *Listen, Acknowledge, Take action, Thank, and Explain.*

Recognizing **critical moments** and applying a prepared method helps reinforce willpower.

> When people act out of **self-choice** rather than **obedience**, self-control feels less exhausting.

People want to feel **in control of their lives**, not controlled by others.

#### The Power of a Crisis

> [!abstract] How Leaders Create Habits by Chance and Design

Crises can reshape organizational habits - they force change where comfort once prevented it.

A company functions effectively **only when its management consciously builds and reinforces habits**.

> Crisis is often the catalyst for transformation.

#### How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do

> [!abstract] When Companies Predict Habits

Companies like Target collect customer data and assign unique IDs to predict behavior - such as identifying when a woman is pregnant based on her purchase patterns.

> **Habits** influence nearly every buying decision we make.

**Shopping habits** often change after major life events (moving, marriage, divorce, etc.).

Humans have a deep **preference for familiarity**.  
Behavioral habits protect us from being overwhelmed by constant decisions.

To teach someone a new habit → link it with something familiar.  
> Introduce **new behaviors** by blending them with **existing habits** - people accept the "new" more easily.

#### The Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott

> [!abstract] How Movements Emerge

> *Social habits* - the unconscious behaviors shared by many people - can quietly reshape the world.

Movements begin with **friendships** and spread through **"weak ties"** - connections that are neither strangers nor close friends.

**Social pressure** and **group habits** lead individuals to follow group expectations.  
These patterns often spread through weak social links.

> Movements grow from social habits that begin as friendships and evolve into shared beliefs.

#### The Neurology of Free Will

> [!abstract] Are We Responsible for Our Habits?

We **can** change our habits once we **understand how they work** and **decide** to take responsibility.

> Awareness brings responsibility.  
> Once you recognize a habit, you are accountable for changing it.

#### How to Change Your Own Habits

> [!info] There is no single formula for behavior change.

##### Steps to Change a Habit

1. **Identify the routine**  
2. **Experiment with rewards** (try different ones)  
3. **Isolate the cue**  
4. **Create a plan**

To understand a habit, analyze the elements of the **habit loop**:

##### Experiment with Rewards

Rewards are powerful because they satisfy deep **cravings** - whether for pleasure, relief, or emotional comfort.  
Test different rewards to discover what truly drives the behavior.

##### Isolate the Cue

> Why and through what is the habit triggered?

Common cue categories:

1. Location  
2. Time  
3. Emotional state  
4. Other people  
5. Immediately preceding action  

Example:

1. I'm sitting at my desk  
2. It's 3:36 PM  
3. I feel bored  
4. I'm alone  
5. I just answered an email  


##### Create a Plan

A **habit** follows a predictable formula your brain automatically executes:

> When I see a **cue**, I perform a **routine** to get a **reward**.

To change or build a habit, use **implementation intentions** - concrete "if-then" plans.

Example:  

> Every day at 7:00 AM, I will go to the park and run for 20 minutes.

### Personal Reflection  
It was nice to read something about habits again. I had already heard about many of the things in the book "Atomic Habits." Nevertheless, there were some new aspects that I found interesting. As for whether it helped me change my habits, I would say this: "Atomic Habits" did a very good job of presenting various methods for building new habits, such as "implementation intentions," but this book also focuses very well on changing current "bad" habits and, moreover, on how the world "ticks".

### Would I Recommend It?  
Yes, sure, go for it.

### Looking Ahead  
The next book in 2025 is from Jordan B. Peterson called "**12 Rules of Life**". I am not sure if I will summarize it. Other books would be: 

- **A Brief History of Time** from Stephen Hawking - no summary here
- **Das einzige Buch, das Du über Finanzen lesen solltest** a German book about finance - probably will do a short **summary** here :)
